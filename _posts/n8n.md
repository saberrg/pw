This is a review of n8n which I understand it to be a simple business workflow automator. I will share my experience with making an account and playing around with it in the 14 day free trial. I have never used n8n, I just heard about it from a friend. I develop software, this is a new territory for me, so let's go through this journey. 


After signing up and making an account this is the first view I see.

I typed in hi and one of the things that I quickly realized is that I need to make an OpenAI account! To use the openAI model which is the template that I started off with. 

One of the questions I wondered about is there a way I can use other models, besides OpenAI? Just wanted to browse before making credentials for OpenAI. 

Then I looked at the other templates I can use at https://n8n.io/workflows/ 

I immediately got a bit lost and overwhelmed, so I went to check out the help stuff they had. I checked out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MwSoB0gnM4

Then I hopped on the documentation page: 
https://docs.n8n.io/try-it-out/tutorial-first-workflow/#step-two-add-a-trigger-node

And figured that it is better just to create a new project fresh, with no "nodes" like the one in the first image. 

I then got the idea of what my first workflow should be, I will schedule a trigger every day to go to a government api (then later I want to scrap gov websites) and will get that specific info and send it as an email/text to myself. 

This is a great tool I want to use it to gather useful government data.
