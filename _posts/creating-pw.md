In the Gracious name of the Lord Almighty

Here is this space on the internet that I or anyone I choose to can come and host content. I enjoy technology, because of its possibilities and knowledge in tech allows for freedom to do more stuff, creativity, its a way to help others in almost any angle. The design of good software like design patterns and as well as optimizing software. Asking questions like what makes good software, how to write code that is well performant and easily readable and scalable with new features and devs. How to measure good code. These questions contain my genuine curiosity and I will share what I find and my thoughts on this corner of the internet. 

Along with just more random and general content that I will try to make it my own (not to just copy others) not that there's anything inherently wrong with that (must give credit), but to do myself and an interested reader justice so that they come here to read original content and commentary. 

In a typical programming fashion, I say to you, Hello. Hello World. 

In Good Health and to the Will of our Heavenly Father. Until next time
