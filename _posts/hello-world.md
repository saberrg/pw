In the Most High Name. 


There comes a time in a programmer's life where they would need to make a website. Whether for academics, for fun or whatever. Maybe you never do it. That's all good. 

Personally, I found it to be the very first thing to do. A website, show your friends, customize it, be creative. What a time to be alive and well. 

Then after making a bunch of half assed websites that no longer see the light of day. Which is ok, this is good experimentation. There comes a time where word gets around and someone asks you to make them a website for their business!

What a wonderful opportunity and we get right to it. 

As you may already know there is more than one way to skin a bird. This also relates to making a website. As a novice, non technical website creator who also wishes to ensure that the client has a stable platform to spread there wings and fly. The choice was to go with an old giant, Wordpress.
