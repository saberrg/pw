The goal is to make a decent web scrapper and it should also interact with the website. The goal is to go to a given website, interact with the website (like search for something) then scrap that data and later we will store it somewhere to analyze/use. I do understand that some websites don't allow this kind of stuff so I will ensure to follow any rules on this stuff that targetted websited has put forth.
