Love your job. If you don't like your job, go get a job you like. Duh!

Anyways you can't change your job, don't be a victim. Be gratful you have a job. 

On the note of loving your job, when you enter this headspace. You will quickly find the new thought space of how to provide value. Be in love with learning. The job that I got aware of this kind of method was when I was in the warehouse, not even cool enough to drive a forklift. I was tying the cargo down, grueling good old manual labor! Well imagine you're in a warehouse in this 8 hour day, I and fellow colleagues are tying cargo, pallets. Which is like a big sheet of cargo, boxes, bins, whatever. I started counting how many pallets my team can tie up! Then I'm like how does this warehousing thing. I have been so facisnated in this dynamics of logistics and moving cargo. So awesome. So awesome in fact there will be a post about the business of cargo! The blood of the economy.

Back to being a good employee. Don't love your job, do extra work. I hear the voice already "OH THIS MAN WANTS ME TO WORK HARDER TAKE ON EXTRA WORK OH MY WHAT A MONSTER!". Look why is extra work given, cause your boss likes you. If its back breakin labor like there is just no way your body can take this grueling then all bets are off you do boo. But look for you to climb that corporate you must love your job. Love the people. Love the process. Love the problems...


Going to the next point, quickly find out the pain points of your superior. Look if you really hate your job and for some odd reason you can't change jobs. Then channel that hatred to getting a promotion and how do you do it? Fix problems. People have problems and organizations surely has problems! If there's no problems then there is no innovation! Problem is a good thing. While we're here lets take a moment and understand that the word itself has such negative connotation. Just reframe that word. Welcome problems. Once you've welcomed problems. You don't complain, you can't blessings. You become in a better headspace. And you become a good worker. 

Next point, don't be a robot. We see the progressions of AI, that technology MIGHT be coming for your job! I am a developer and use AI all the time. I had my foot in the door before this whole AI craze, but right now, I can't imaging typing and coding shit now! Granted you do have to have a strong sense of programming and design, which vibe coders don't get the pleasure of doing! Anyways. Don't be a robot. Meaning give personality, go the extra mile, be observant be innovative. As techie in software, I give ideas all the time to improve the software. Be useful to the team. I am the world's happiest tool.
