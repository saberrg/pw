For posts with the "books" tag, I will be giving chapter by chapter notes an the book. Purpose of this is to take notes to share to the world. I recommend to pick the book up yourself to read it, but for me. Sometimes I'd love to have stuff summarized! At many points the books will make outsied references and I will try to capture those tangents in a elegant way for the things that get my attention.
